# Steps to create a _GitHub Pages_ website

- **Log in or create a new _GitHub_ account**
- **Create a new repository**  
  Click on the "_+_ menu", in the upper right corner, and select the _New repository_ option; or click on the _Start project_ button on the welcome page.

  Use whatever name you want. Do note, however, that the name will be part of the _URL_ to accesss the website.

  > For this example this will suffice; for more complex projects, a separate branch would be better in order to separate source code from generated code.  
- **Test your website**  
  When you complete the previous step you will be presented with the _URL_ to your website, click it to verify that it works.

  > The _URL_ of the website will be `http(s)://<your github account name>.github.io/<your repository name>/`, but this can be changed using the _Custom domain_ option. Or; you will want to look into a more traditional hosting solution, this is more to get something fast up that you can test and share with a smaller set of people.  

  > Initially your website will be pretty empty, either a generic page or a _HTML_ version of your _README.md_ file. This will improve however when you add some source and point to a proper _index.html_ file.
